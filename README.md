# Elvin

Elvin is a C++11 pattern-based audio scheduling library.  It is designed to make it simple to express complex melodic and rhythmic ideas using sequences of deterministic and stochastic processes.

## Using Elvin

Elvin is a header-only library.  To use Elvin:

1. Include Elvin by adding the following to your project:
	```cpp
	#include "elvin.h"
	```
2. Add the directory which contains `elvin.h` to your compiler's include path.

If you need faster compilation times then you can only include the parts of Elvin which you need to use, for example:

```cpp
#include "elvin/scheduler.h
```

## Examples

### Using patterns

Patterns are the building blocks of Elvin.  They are simple classes which generate sequences of std::tuple objects.  The tuples consist of three values:

1. A floating point containing the next value generated by the pattern, or zero if the pattern has finished.
2. A boolean representing whether the value comes from a PLiteral (which represents a literal floating point value), or a more complex pattern.
3. A boolean indicating whether the pattern has finished.

In this example we create a PSequence, a simple pattern which moves through a list of values, and print each value from the pattern.

```cpp
#include "elvin.h"
```
